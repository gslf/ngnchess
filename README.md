### 🧐 What's this?

Welcome to **ngnchess** (pronounced *engine-chess*, clever, huh?), a C# library engineered for chess enthusiasts, developers, and AI overlords. Yes, I know there are countless chess libraries out there, but ours isn't just about chess, it's about engineering chess software the way it should be. Clean, efficient, maintainable, and just a tiny bit over-engineered (because why not?).

### 🚀 Mission Statement

We're not merely reinventing the wheel; we're crafting a Formula 1 tire. If you ever dreamt about a chess library as clean and beautiful as Kasparov’s immortal games, you're in the right repo.

### ✨ Features (so far...)

| Component                           | Status             | Comments                             |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Core Board Object & Data Structures | ✅ Done            | Solid foundation, no bugs found (yet) |
| FEN Parser & Tools                  | 🕒 WiP             | Undergoing intense debate            |
| PGN Parser & Tools                  | ⏳ Planned         | Coming soon to a branch near you     |
| Text-based Parser & Tools           | ⏳ Planned         | ASCII art, anyone?                   |
| Chess Engine Interface              | ⏳ Planned         | Because engines need love too        |
| Game Analyzer                       | ⏳ Planned         | For when losing gracefully isn’t enough |

### 📖 Documentation

Documentation will soon populate this repository, assuming I remember to push it.

### 🛠️ Installation

We'll provide NuGet packages when this thing actually does something more useful than storing data.

### 💻 Example Usage (currently aspirational)

They are coming, trust me.


### 📜 License

MIT License. Feel free to do (almost) anything you like.

Made with ♟️ and coffee by an engineer who dream about code refactoring and chess. Simultaneously.
